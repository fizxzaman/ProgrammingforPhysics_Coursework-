# King's College London (BSc (Hons) Physics with Astrophysics and Cosmology): Mathematics and Computation for Physics: Assessment Coursework (1st Year Undergraduate)
Hello, my name is Fiza Zaman and this is my first-year undergraduate programming assessment for the "Mathematics and Computation for Physics" module, where I obtained 100%. Questions related to molecular conformers, logistic maps, and projectile motion.

In this course, I worked using the Jupyter environment on CoCalc, learning to code solutions to scientific problems in Python 3.

This course covered:
1. Variables and Modules
2. Types and Strings
3. "While" loops
4. Lists, list comprehension, and looping lists
5. Functions and files
6. Array arithmetic and Numpy arrays
7. Linear algebra
8. Symbolic Programming
